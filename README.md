# KONG SiLo USB NFC Tool

## Description

Node script for verifying KONG SiLos via a NFC USB reader such as the [ACR-122](https://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/3/acr122u-usb-nfc-reader/). Learn more about SiLos at [KONG Cash](https://kong.cash/) and [KONG Land](https://kong.land/).

## Environment

Tested on MacOS and Raspbian with `node` 17.1.0 and `npm` 8.1.2. The key package `nfc-pcsc` may be tricky to install as it requires certain dependencies. See the [nfc-pcsc repo](https://github.com/pokusew/nfc-pcsc) for more information.

## Arguments

- `command`: The command code sent to the SiLo. See possible command codes referenced below.
- `block`: The desired blockhash to include within the SiLo signature. If blank, a random number is used.
- `to_addr`: The desired Ethereum address to include within the SiLo signature. If blank, a random number is used.
- `pubkey`: Force usage of another ECDSA P256 public key in order to validate the signature. Useful when validating a `tertiaryPublicKey` signature on a subsequent tap.
- `json`: Indicate via boolean whether or not to print out certain SiLo values in a JSON blob. Note that under command `00` these values are missing the `tertiaryPublicKey`. NOTE: requires an `export` dir to be present in the root project directory to be created.
- `verify`: Boolean, use the script in verification mode; if a corresponding JSON file exists for a SiLo in `/export`, this command will move the file to `/verify` if the device successfully generates a signature. NOTE: requires `export` and `verify` dirs to be present in the root project directory.
- `scanonce`: Boolean, activate with `=y`, will kill script after scanning a single SiLo.
- `matchFile`: Match devices listed in a file. See `example-match.json` for formatting. `primaryPublicKeyHash` is expected. `name` and `poap` are optional to show a name and render a POAP URL as QR code.
- `testMatch` : Test matching a device that you don't have on hand to scan.
- `saveSig` : Save the signature of the device. You must create a `signatures` directory.

### SiLo Command Codes

The first generation SiLo's, including KONG Cash and KONG Passports, will accept the following command codes:

- `00`: Generate a signature from a 32 byte input (typically a hash comprised of a random number and recent blockhash or a user's address and recent blockhash)
- `55`: This is a special command with only a limited set of uses. It will generate a signature using the ECDSA keypair associated with `tertiaryPublicKey`. It first generation SiLo's it can be used a maximum of 5 times before refusing to sign additional data.
- `56`: This is a special command that will reveal the `tertiaryPublicKey` which is not normally shown in any of the NDEF records.
- `a5`: This is a special reformat command that will rewrite the public key information from the secure element to the NFC chip. This command may help to recover a chip that cannot product valid signatures and may be need to be repeated or alternated with `00` in order to recover a chip.

## Exmaple

```
node src/scan.js --command=00 --block=3c2877a9a9701eb80ce3974a14e0a1ab80308c1cb9907c5a0a30f4c0945c3180
```

## Notes

### NFC Scanner

You must have an NFC scanner in order to use this script. Occasionally driver issues require system reboot. Tested with the ACR122U-A9 scanner.

### KONG Cash note values.

```
1 KONG   = 1000000000000000000
5 KONG   = 5000000000000000000
10 KONG  = 10000000000000000000
20 KONG  = 20000000000000000000
50 KONG  = 50000000000000000000
100 KONG = 100000000000000000000
500 KONG = 500000000000000000000
```

### Recovering a Chip

In the event you have a KONG Cash note or Passport that will not reliably create signatures that can be verified, you may attempt a recovery by using the `a5` reformat command. To do this, run the script in `command` mode with `a5` as the command; no other parameters are required.

You may need to run the command 2-3 times; in between attempting to reformat the note or Passport, run command `00` to see if a valid signature can be produced (`verification worked? true`). Once a valid signature is produced, do not run the `a5` command again unless future corruption occurs.
